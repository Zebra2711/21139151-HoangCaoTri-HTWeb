          Welcome to the Sunny Acres Corn Maze. We first heard about mazes from
          agricultural exchange students who came from England in 1985. In
          Europe, mazes are very popular in castle gardens. After hearing about
          the mazes in Europe, we thought it would be a great idea to build one
          of our own right outside of Council Bluffs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since 1997, thousands of people have enjoyed our Corn Mazes. We hope
          that your family gets as much enjoyment out of this year's Corn Maze
          as we did building it! Our family would like to invite your family to
          come out and visit us at this year's Corn Maze and AutumnFest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our new 15-acre maze (with over 4 miles of trails to explore) is
          filled with twist and turns thatï¿½s good fun for adults and kids alike!
          See how adventurous you are as you wind through the maze while taking
          an interactive quiz. Answer the questions correctly and receive
          additional clues to solve the maze. For families with young children,
          our maze is filled with jokes, riddles and quests. Try to be the first
          in your group to punch out your quest card by visiting the secret
          spots. This maze is the perfect size and height for little ones.
          Resting places and educational displays are scattered throughout.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no water available in the maze. Make sure you bring water
          bottles with you! No one under the age of 12 will be allowed in the
          maze without an adult at any time.
